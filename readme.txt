Enable plugins for selected blogs only on multisite websites (similar to theme functionality)

== Description ==

This plugin adds a new "Plugins" tab to the site edit screen where you can enable or disable plugins for this website. You may enable/disable one at a time or per bulk action. The site admin will only see plugins that are enabled for his site or for the entire network. He still can decide if he wants to activate it or not.

Finally you'll be able to install plugins that do not show to every single website in your multisite network!
